Goal: Title:
AcmeCo / (Department?) / (Gender?) / Person's Name

-------

Start by doing activate / deactive and setting the title there
  -> collisions
  -> this becomes repetetive and ripe for problems (what about a route that doesn't set the title)

Then try a didTransition on your application route
  -> See commits
  -> Once it's all done, do a quick re-cap code walkthrough

But it's a good thing that someone already did all of this work for us.
  -> Intro the addon (show github page)
  -> remove our code
  -> install the addon
  -> show how everything still works
  -> Do a quick code walkthrough on their end highlighting the DOM rendering at the bottom for FastBoot support
