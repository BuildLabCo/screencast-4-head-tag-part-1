-> Intro the app
-> Hover over the tab
-> Show the <head> in the HTML
-> Change the title in the index.html
-> Great, but I want to update the title when routes change

Learned in prev. screencasts about the activate hook, so let's try that
add document.title to activate hook

Now update the person route with the activate hook

-> Browser start in the people, have the inspector open
-> Now click a person
-> ensure you can see the title was overriden
